# Samuel Silva - Browser Extension

This extension replaces all images and texts (almost & literally) with a political figure in Brazil.<br>
Note that this is not supposed to be taken seriously and if you don't agree with it, not our problem.

## How to install:

Note that this tutorial is written with Google Chrome, so in other browsers it could not be the same way.

1. Go to **chrome://extensions/** and click on **Developer Mode** to enable it.
2. Download the ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/NotAkih/samuelsilva/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it in a folder.
3. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the folder you extracted the files.
4. Boom! It's done!

> To disable the extension just go again over **chrome://extensions/** and remove it.
